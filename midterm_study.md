After watching, answer these TWO simple questions (1–2 sentences each):

 1. What is one thing you learned or were reminded of from any of the videos?
    Far-apart color harmonies can be visually striking, which makes them risky to use but attention-grabbing
 2. How can one of these topics (color, typography, or composition) help you on the midterm?
    Knowing typography will be helpful for making professional-looking marketing materials.

(Short, simple answers. No overthinking.)

## Part 2 — Photoshop & Illustrator Mini-Check / Watch Relevant Videos

Using the study guide, answer three quick questions:

 1. In Photoshop, why do designers use layer masks instead of the eraser?
    > To edit non-destructively, so you can easily revert changes
 2. When would someone use CMYK instead of RGB?
    > Printers physicallly operate in CMYK, so it's best to make printed designs in that color space
 3. What is one thing you want to remember during the midterm (example: naming layers, checking color mode, exporting correctly, etc.)?
    > Various tool functions (quick editing pencil, brush strokes, mesh gradients, etc.)

(Again: 1–2 sentences per question.)

## Part 3 — Tiny Creative Thinking Reflection

Choose ONE design you made this semester (poster, sticker, tote bag, etc.).
Answer:

What is one design choice you made on purpose (color, font, placement, etc.), and why did you make it?
> For my sticker design, I decided to make the outlines a very dark blue instead of pure black.
> I think this made them a little more visually interesting and better integrated into the design.
> Since my color theme was mostly purple with some blue, I picked the blue color to add a bit of
> contrast and variation.

1–3 sentences only.
